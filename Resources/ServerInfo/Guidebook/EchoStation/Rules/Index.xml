  # Server Rules
  Welcome to Echo Station! We're a high-roleplay SS14 server. This means we value the story more than the outcome.
  If you want to see chaos and blow things up, this is not the server for you.

  ## Core Rules
  These rules are universal and apply at [bold]all[/bold] times, including between rounds.

  ## Roleplay Rules
  These rules only apply during a round. A round ends only when the game returns to the lobby. [color=#ff0000]All of these rules apply fully whenever the game is not at the lobby unless it is in an exempt game mode.[/color]

  The deathmatch and sandbox game modes are exempt from these rules. Players who choose to not follow these rules are entirely responsible for knowing if an exempt game mode is active.

  Roleplay rules do not apply to ghosts/spectators/observers while they are ghosts/spectators/observers. Dead chat is considered to be an in-game out of character chat channel.

  See the list of [textlink="role types" link="RoleTypes"] for more information about the different types of roles.
